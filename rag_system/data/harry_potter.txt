On the morning of his eleventh birthday, Elias Grey discovered that the world
was not as ordinary as he had always believed.

A tall woman in a dark blue coat arrived at his doorstep and handed him a letter
sealed with silver wax. The letter informed him that he had been accepted into
Alderwyn Academy, a school for students with magical abilities.

When Elias entered the academy for the first time, floating lanterns lit the
great hall, and ancient portraits whispered to one another along the walls.
The air itself seemed alive with hidden power.

During his first lesson, Elias was given a wooden wand that felt strangely warm
in his hand. As he focused, the candles in the room flickered and rose into the air.
The instructor smiled quietly — raw magic had awakened.
